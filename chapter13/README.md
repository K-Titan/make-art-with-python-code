# Chapter 13 - Exporting our Tesselations for Print

In this chapter, we take our newly created tesselations, and make them into things we can use in other programs.

There's even a bonus Python program in this directory to turn your tesselations into a 3D printable object!

## Challenges

Read the code for the `draw3DPrint.py` file. It needs to have OpenScad installed, along with pstoedit, two external programs.

Install them and generate your 3D printed object from your program!
