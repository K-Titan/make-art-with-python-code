# Chapter 11 - Drawing Infinities

In this chapter, we make tiled images like the kind M.C. Escher used to make. But drawing such images is difficult, and we can program now! So let's use a computer to explore how his drawings work.

M.C. Escher created artistic tessellations, which is the term mathematicians use for when a two-dimensional plane is tiled infinitely without any gaps. We'll do the same with Pygame.

## Challenges

Can you add a way to spin all the hexagons while they tesselate?

Can you add a way to animate the triangles within the hexagons back to squares?
