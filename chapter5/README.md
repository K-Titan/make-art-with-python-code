# Chapter 5 - Reading the User's Mind with Input

In this chapter, our program becomes interactive for the first time! We learn how to make the keyboard update the graphics on our screen.

You'll build a cursor out of your earlier line functions, and then watch as you can control it and draw.

If your program runs too slow, try changing your `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`. Making them smaller should make your program run faster.

For the `cursorDraw` program, you must hold down the spacebar to draw while moving the cursor.

## Challenges

Add more keys to change colors while drawing. 

Can you figure out how to support multiple colors at the same time?
