# Chapter 3 - Writing Our First Graphics Program

In this chapter, we install the `pygame` library, and use it to draw our very first pixel on the screen.

From here, we use the `for` loop to make our very first line cross the screen.

We then see how to make our lines diagonal.

## Challenges

Try drawing a square with multiple lines across the screen.

Try drawing lines that form a triangle.
