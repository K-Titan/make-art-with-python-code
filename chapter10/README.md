# Chapter 10 - Painting with Images

In this chapter, we’ll take a side trip, and learn to manipulate images in our programs. We’ll walk through how images work, and how they’re loaded and saved. Finally, we’ll learn to transform a series of images into movies.

Along the way, we’ll also learn how to break images, creating new, glitched versions of the things we’ve made. Hopefully we’ll also learn something new about the way our computers work.

## Challenges

Try making an animated gif from a series of your rotated images. You can search for the `ffmpeg` program, and send it a set of images as frames.
