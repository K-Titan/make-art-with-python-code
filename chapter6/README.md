# Chapter 6 - Playing More with Loops

In this chapter, we focus more on using loops, and how they can be made to do even more.

We'll see how to use things like sine waves, along with changing values to make our drawing program more interesting.

## Challenges

Our main loop in `mirrorRainbow.py` is really long! Can you turn the square flipping of the draw space into a function instead? 

How about the sine waves? Is there something else we can do to make it simpler?
