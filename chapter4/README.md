# Chapter 4 - Functions: The Building Blocks of Programs

In this chapter, we turn our `for` loops into functions that let us draw lines of any size we want.

We use the `random` library to let us create our first moving program.

## Challenges

Create a function to draw squares by using your new `draw_vertical_line` and `draw_flat_line` functions.
