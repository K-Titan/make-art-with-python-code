# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

In this chapter, we install the Python interpreter, and see how programs run in Python.

The program in this chapter draws using the Turtle library, and allows us to see something on the screen with just a few commands.

Remember, you can save the file in an editor, and then just run:

```
$ python3 first.py
```

The program will exit when you click the close button on the drawing window.
