# Chapter 2 - Computational Thinking

In this chapter, we learn the basics of how a program works. We learn `if` statements, and basic loops.

Your program lets you tell the computer what type of shape to draw, and then it draws it.

## Challenges

Try adding more shapes. A pentagon has five sides, and each turn is 72 degrees. A hexagon has six sides, and each turn is 60 degrees. 

Look up the Python `turtle` library. See if you can find out how to draw a circle. Add drawing a circle to the program.
